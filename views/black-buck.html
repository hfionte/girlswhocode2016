            The Blackbuck is an endangered and fully protected species in Nepal. One of the blackbuckâ€™s most striking features is the pair of long, spiralling horns possessed by the male, which are marked with rings and sweep backwards from the head in a v-shaped arrangement. The male blackbuck is larger than the female and more conspicuously coloured, with the coat being a rich dark brown along the back, sides and the outsides of the legs. The coat of the female is yellowish-brown on the head and along the back. <br>
            One of the blackbuck's most noticable features is its spirialing horns, which are characteristics of the males. 
            It is the only member of the genus <em>antilope</em> found in India, and their population has been reduced majorly by poaching and hunting.
